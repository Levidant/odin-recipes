     <h2></h2>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>  
     <p>French fries (North American English), chips (British English and other national varities),[1] finger chips (Indian English),[2] french-fried potatoes, or simply fries, are batonnet or allumette-cut[3] deep-fried potatoes of disputed origin from Belgium and France.</p>
     <p>They are prepared by cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them, usually in a deep fryer. Pre-cut, blanched, and frozen russet potatoes are widely used, and sometimes baked in a regular or convection oven; air fryers are small convection ovens marketed for frying potatoes.</p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>500 grms potatoes</li>
        <li>2 cups of refined oil</li>
        <li>Salt as requeried</li>
        <li>3 pinches black pepper</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: To prepare this easy recipe, you need to make sure that they are cut in the right shape and size. They should neither be too thick, nor too thin and should be cut clean and sharp. The trick is to first slice the potatoes and then cut them lengthwise. You can also use a fries cutter for that long, even shape.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Now, wash the potatoes under running water till they are squeaky clean. Place them in a bowl of iced water for 10 to 15 minutes. Keep them submerged in water or they will turn black.</li>
    <li>Step 3: Now, heat the oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the smoke starts appearing, reduce the flame and allow it to acquire a lower temperature. Now, deep fry the potatoes in batches. Keep the flame low. This will make them crunchy and also help retain their colour.</li>
    <li>Step 4: Drain excess oil and place them on an absorbent paper. Allow them to cool. Now sprinkle salt and pepper and toss well. Serve immediately with ketchup. They can also be served with burgers and cutlets.</li>
